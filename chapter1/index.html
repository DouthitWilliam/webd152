    <p>Never drank any form of coffee or tea, but I have had a large assortment of beverages. One of my favorites is Milkis which truthfully I haven't had in almost a year. Milkis are a kind of soda you can nab at H-Mart that's basically carbonated milk. It doesn't sound that good on paper, but it's a great mixture of tastes tasting moreso like soda a bit more than milk.</p>
